# model_structures

working project to visually model pn diodes and eventually transistors based on their material properties

- `mod_gui_tkinter.py` is the starter code the initializes the gui and program
- `mod_funcs.py` contains the general program functions aside from gui stuff
- `mod_materials.py` contains the necessary data for the materials
